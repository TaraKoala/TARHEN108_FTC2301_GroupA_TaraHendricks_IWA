# Interactive Web Apps JavaScript Fundamentals

## IWA_02 Challenges 1 - 3

### Challenge 1
The following code is meant to log the following two variables to the console at the same time:

<ul>
<li>user</li>
<li>surname</li>
</ul>

At the moment nothing happens when the code runs. Please fix the issue, while keeping the comments associated with the variables.

### Challenge 2
The following code should take the date variable and log it to the console. It is important that the code is commented on correctly. Please confirm that the correct tooltip is showing for the date value in VS Code as well.

### Challenge 3
The following code should print a warning to the console, indicating that security scanning has started. It should also print an info message to the console, informing users that they should wait for the scan to complete before closing the browser. It is important that these comments are kept in the code for context to future developers.

 

Currently, the code fails to even run at all.
